# SCRU128: Sortable, Clock and Random number-based Unique identifier

SCRU128 ID is yet another attempt to supersede [UUID] in the use cases that need
decentralized, globally unique time-ordered identifiers. SCRU128 is inspired by
[ULID] and [KSUID] and has the following features:

- 128-bit unsigned integer type
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 26-digit case-insensitive portable textual representation
- 44-bit biased millisecond timestamp that ensures remaining life of 550 years
- Up to 268 million time-ordered but unpredictable unique IDs per millisecond
- 84-bit _layered_ randomness for collision resistance

```rust
use scru128::{scru128, scru128_string};

// generate a new identifier object
let x = scru128();
println!("{}", x); // e.g. "00S6GVKR1MH58KE72EJD87SDOO"
println!("{}", x.as_u128()); // as a 128-bit unsigned integer

// generate a textual representation directly
println!("{}", scru128_string()); // e.g. "00S6GVKR3F7R79I72EJF0J4RGC"
```

See [SCRU128 Specification] for details.
