# SCRU128: Sortable, Clock and Random number-based Unique identifier

SCRU128 ID is yet another attempt to supersede [UUID] in the use cases that need
decentralized, globally unique time-ordered identifiers. SCRU128 is inspired by
[ULID] and [KSUID] and has the following features:

- 128-bit unsigned integer type
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 26-character case-insensitive portable textual representation
- 44-bit biased millisecond timestamp that ensures remaining life of 550 years
- Up to 268 million time-ordered but unpredictable unique IDs per millisecond
- 84-bit _layered_ randomness for collision resistance

```rust
use scru128::scru128;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", scru128()); // e.g. "00POIIIQ3EU27VB0CO5T1KBR20"
    println!("{}", scru128()); // e.g. "00POIIIQ3EU27VD0CO5TB187QQ"
}
```
